plusfeed.pl

NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION YET!!!!

(Not) port of python plusfeed (tool which translate public Google+ posts of particular user to RSS) 
https://github.com/russellbeattie/plusfeed

As time of writing Google not provide RSS feeds in Google+. There are many similar projects -
https://github.com/russellbeattie/plusfeed - Python on GoogleAppengine, public installation was closed.
https://github.com/tedkulp/gplusfeed - Node.js on Heroku, Heroku costs money.
https://github.com/AntonTyutin/gp2rss - Node.js
but I can't find anything on Perl, so, I write it by myself :)

Program consists couple of parts
PlusFeed.pm - main module
plusfeed_simple.cgi - Simple cgi
plusfeed_wcache.cgi - Simple cgi with caching
plusfeed.psgi - PSGI interface (TODO)

INSTALLATION

Install dependencises - 
Google::Plus
XML::RSS
CHI + drivers ( if needed, for caching - see https://metacpan.org/module/CHI )

Put appropriate CGI in cgi-bin and edit - 
1. KEY - Provide own Google+ API key (https://code.google.com/apis/console/)
2. USER - Google+ user id.
3. PAGES - 0 - all pages, 1- last page, 2 - last 2 pages.
4. cache_ttl - caching time - if you need it (in seconds).

Fancy PSGI interface and fancy HTML pages for CGI will be really soon
