plusfeed.pl

NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION YET!!!!

(Not) port of python plusfeed (tool which translate public Google+ posts of particular user to RSS) 
https://github.com/russellbeattie/plusfeed

As time of writing Google not provide RSS feeds in Google+. There are many similar projects -
https://github.com/russellbeattie/plusfeed - Python on GoogleAppengine.
https://github.com/tedkulp/gplusfeed - Node.js on Heroku.
https://github.com/AntonTyutin/gp2rss - Node.js
but I can't find anything on Perl, so, I write it by myself :)
There is no public service for G+ RSS translation AFAIK - plusfeed was closed because of change prices on AppEngine,
gplusfeed.heroku.com also not working. So, purpose of this project is to provide simple and reliable piece of code 
for anyone who want to translate G+ posts to RSS 

FILES

PlusFeed.pm - main module
plusfeed_simple.cgi - Simple cgi (for personal use)
plusfeed_wcache.cgi - Simple cgi with caching (for personal use)

INSTALLATION

Install dependencises -

Put appropriate CGI in cgi-bin and edit - 
1. KEY - Provide own Google+ API key (https://code.google.com/apis/console/)
2. USER - Google+ user id.
3. PAGES - 0 - all pages, 1- last page, 2 - last 2 pages, etc.
