Port of Russell Beattie's Plusfeed https://github.com/russellbeattie/plusfeed
(tool which translate public Google+ posts of particular user to Atom feed) 

RATIONALE

As time of writing Google do not provides RSS/Atom feeds in Google+. 
There are many similar projects -
https://github.com/russellbeattie/plusfeed - Python on GoogleAppengine.
https://github.com/tedkulp/gplusfeed - Node.js on Heroku.
https://github.com/AntonTyutin/gp2rss - Node.js
but I can't find anything on Perl, so, I write it by myself :)
Also there is no public service for G+ RSS translation AFAIK - Russel's public 
Plusfeed http://plusfeed.appspot.com was closed because of changing prices on AppEngine,
Public instance of gplusfeed at http://gplusfeed.herokuapp.com also not working (at least for me). 
So, purpose of this project is to provide simple and reliable piece of code for anyone 
who want to translate G+ posts to RSS/Atom, until Google do not provide this 

FILES

PlusFeed.pm - main module.
PlusFeed/Atom.pm - module for Atom feed instead of RSS.
plusfeed_simple.cgi - Simple cgi ( good for personal use )
plusfeed_wcache.cgi - Advanced cgi ( with caching on Redis DB and Atom feed, also good for personal use)

- PSGI application with Atom feed and caching using files. 
Even public service can be provided using this, but remember that free G+ API key have 1000 req/day limit.
Also ready for run at Heroku (http://heroku.com) or ActiveState Stackato cloud (http://stackato.com)
You can use my instance there - http://plusfeed-pl.herokuapp.com/

4. PSGI application at Heroku (http://heroku.com)
  Edit app.psgi
APIKEY - Provide own Google+ API key (https://code.google.com/apis/console/)
BASE_URL - Base URL of your application (http://<YOURAPPNAME>.herokuapp.com/)
  Then run

Then
stackato push YOURAPPNAME
makes all magic. :)
Really good thing, give it a try.
